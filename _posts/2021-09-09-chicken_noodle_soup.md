# Chicken noodle soup

## Ingredients
### Noodle
* 6 cups chicken broth [6 cups water; 46 g. chicken bullion paste].
* 1 bay leaf.
* 1/2 lb. fresh or frozen egg noodles.

### Soup
* 80 g [2/3 cup] chopped celery.
* 90 g [2/3 cup] chopped carrot.
* 80 g [2/3 cup] diced onion.
* 3/4 tsp. parsley.
* 1/8 tsp. rubbed thyme.
* 3/8 tsp. pepper.

### Roux
* 42 g [3 tbsp.] butter.
* 15 g [2 tbsp.] flour.

### Finishing
* 2 tbsp. sherry.
* 3 tbsp. cream.[^cream]

### Chicken
* 1 lb. cooked chicken.[^chicken]

## Procedure
1. Bring the chicken broth to a boil.
   Add the noodles and bay leaf and simmer for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Add the soup ingredients.
   Simmer, uncovered, until the vegetables are tender but not overcooked, about ten minutes.[^saltiness]
3. Meanwhile, prepare the roux:
   In the skillet, melt the butter, add the flour, and cook over low heat for two minutes.
   (The mixture should lightly boil: enough to thicken, but not enough to scald the butter.)
4. Once the vegetables are nearly done, remove the bay leaf, and add the roux and the sherry.
   Simmer, stirring, for two minutes, then extinguish the heat.
   Stir in the cream.
5. Allow the soup to cool close to the temperature at which the chicken was cooked.
   Mix in the chicken.
   The soup is best after it rests for at least half an hour.
   The soup may satisfactorily be frozen.

## Credits
I adapted this recipe from that given on a bag of Reames-brand frozen egg noodles.

[^cream]:
    The original recipe would have had 2/3 cup cream, which I thought overpowered the other flavors and made the soup taste like a chowder.

[^chicken]:
    At one measurement, I found that bone-in chicken thighs produced usable meat, juice, and scrap at a ratio of 6:3:1:2.

[^saltiness]:
    Using Better than Bullion broth, I sometimes notice that the soup tastes too salty, but the saltiness will diffuse into the unsalted chicken and come out right.
