# Barbecue sauce
My mother and I invented this in 2020 as a general-use barbecue sauce.
I prefer it to any that I've bought: it has a similar flavor to Sweet Baby Ray's but is not so sweet.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup ketchup.
* 3 tbsp. brown sugar.
* 1/4 cup molasses.
* 1/2 tsp. salt.
* 1/2 tsp. ginger.
* 1/2 tsp. garlic.
* 3/4 tsp. liquid smoke.
* 1 tsp. lemon juice (or vinegar).

## Procedure
1. Mix all of the ingredients together in a suitable container.
