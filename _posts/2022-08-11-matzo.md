When my grocer stopped carrying whole wheat matzos, I learned to make my own.
I think these taste better.
This is based on the recipe published at: John Besh, *[Homemade Matzos](http://www.finecooking.com/recipe/homemade-matzos)*, *archived at* [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180406122821/http://www.finecooking.com/recipe/homemade-matzos).

## Equipment
* Rolling pin.
* Two baking sheets.

## Ingredients
* 113 g (c. 1 cup) white whole wheat flour.
* Flour for dusting the cutting board.
* 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt.
* Optional but delicious: Cracked pepper.
* 85 g (3/8 cup) water.

## Procedure
1. Mix the ingredents together and knead the resulting dough for five minutes.
2. Divide the dough into two pieces.
2. Roll out each piece as thin as practicable.
   You'll likely need to flour the dough repeatedly while rolling it out.
   For me, each piece takes up most of a half sheet.
3. Place each piece on a half sheet.
   If you'd like to be able to break them without sending shards everywhere, score each piece in a criss-cross pattern
   with a table-knife.
   Bake them at 500Â° for 6.5 minutes, until the bread begins to brown at the edges.
   It will become crispier as it cools.
