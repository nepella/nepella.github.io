# Rice pilaf

## Equipment
* Medium-sized stock pot with lid.

## Ingredients
* 160 g long-grain brown rice.
* A dash (6 g; c. 2 tsp.) olive oil.
* 714 g (2.75 cup) water.
* 35 g wild rice.
* 15 g (c. 2 tsp.) chicken bullion paste.
  (This is equivalent to 1 1/2 tsp. of Diamond Crystal salt. I didn't notice a difference when I reduced the paste to 7 g and added 3/4 tsp. of Diamond Crystal.)
* 1/2 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt.
* A pinch of cayenne pepper flakes.
* Three grinds of black pepper.
* A spoonful (10 g) of butter.

## Procedure
1. Heat a pan on a large burner set to medium-high (no. 5 on my stove) for 3 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, boil water and measure out at least two cups of it for quenching.
3. Toast the rice in the oil for 90 seconds, stirring continually.
4. Immediately pour the water onto the rice.
5. Add any remaining water, the wild rice, the bullion, the seasonings, and the butter.
6. When the rice returns to a simmer, cover it, reduce the heat to medium-low (no. 2.5), and cook it until almost all of the liquid is absorbed (45 to 55 minutes on my stove).
7. Extinguish the heat, and let the rice rest 10 minutes.
8. Fluff the rice with a fork.
