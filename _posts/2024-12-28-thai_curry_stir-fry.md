## Sauce
### Ingredients
#### Simmering
* 3 cups water.
* 1.5 tsp. granulated white sugar.
* 1.5 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt or 0.75 tsp. typical table salt.
* 2 tsp. MSG, ideally fortified with [I+G].[^msg]
* About 1 tsp. minced garlic or 2 tsp. "jarlic."
* About 1 tbsp. crunchy peanut butter.
* Hot chilies to taste.[^chilies]

#### Finishing
* About 2 tsp. Thai curry paste.
* About 3 oz. coconut milk.

### Procedure
1. Simmer the simmering ingredients for ten minutes.
2. Add and dissolve the curry paste.
3. Extinguish the heat and add the coconut milk:
I pour it in until the sauce looks right to me.
Don't overheat the sauce with the coconut milk.[^overheat]

## Stir-fry ingredients
* Tofu.
* Carrot.
* Bell pepper.
* Sugar-snap and snow peas.

## Rice
### Ingredients
* 204 g long-grain white rice.
* 477 g water.
* 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt or 1 tsp. typical table salt.

### Procedure
1. Bring the ingredients to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook the rice for 20 minutes.
   This may take experimentation to get right: on my stove, it cooks perfectly with a burner set to "2."

## Toppings
* Cashews.

[^msg]:
    I buy Make It Meaty-brand I+G [from Amazon] and mix MSG 9–1 by weight with I+G.
    If you don't have MSG, you could probably replace the salt and MSG with broth?
    But you should just buy some MSG and thank me later: it literally stands for "makes stuff good."
    With salt, it's also an effective substitute for chicken broth or Better Than Bouillon paste in most places.
    (Better Than Bouillon chicken base is principally salt, MSG, I+G, and sugar.)

[^chilies]:
    Thai chilies are best: I use eight to twelve roughly chopped.
    Otherwise, habaneros (one to two), dried habaneros, or serranos (six to twelve) will do.
    With dried peppers and sometimes fresh habaneros, I split them in two and remove them before finishing the sauce: most of the heat will dissolve.

[^overheat]:
    165 °F seems to be okay, but, if it reaches boiling, the milk will lose most of its whiteness and some of its flavor.
