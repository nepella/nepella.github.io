# Pancakes

## Equipment
* Medium mixing bowl.
* Two-cup glass measuring cup.
* Whisk.
* Skillet.

## Ingredients
### Dry ingredients
* 120 g [1 cup] flour.
* 1 tsp. sugar.
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder.
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda.
* 1/4 tsp. salt.

### Liquid ingredients
* 270 g [9 fl. oz.] buttermilk or buttermilk substitute.
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract.
* 1/4 cup melted butter.

#### Or: Buttermilk substitute
* 1/2 oz. lemon juice.
* 7 1/2 oz. milk.

## Procedure
1. In the bowl, mix the dry ingredients.
2. In the measuring cup, whisk together the liquid ingredients.
3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
   Pour in the wet mixture in and gently stir everything together.
   Don’t go overboard and mash it all together: everything should be wet but still a bit lumpy.
4. Preheat a pan to on medium heat. Wipe some oil over the surface of the pan, or use spray-on oil.
   Alternatively, use a waffle or pancake machine.
5. Dollop in about 1.5 tbsp. (20 g) per pancake.
   Cook for 3–4 minutes, until small bubbles have formed.
   Flip, and cook for another 2 minutes or so.
   (On my electric range, I heat a cast iron skillet on no. 3 and give the cakes four and a quarter minutes before the flip and three and a quarter minutes after.)
