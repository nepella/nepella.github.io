<img src="{{ '/assets/images/25-P-106230.avif' | relative_url }}" />

## Equipment
* Medium mixing bowl.
* Two-cup glass measuring cup.
* Whisk.
* Skillet.

## Ingredients
### Dry ingredients
* 120 g [1 cup] flour.
* 1 tsp. sugar.
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder.
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda.
* 1/4 tsp. salt.

### Liquid ingredients
* 270 g [9 fl. oz.] buttermilk.
* 1/4 cup melted butter.

## Procedure
1. In the bowl, mix the dry ingredients.
2. In the measuring cup, whisk together the liquid ingredients.
3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
   Pour the wet mixture in and gently stir it together.
   Donâ€™t overdo it: it should still be lumpy.
4. Preheat a pan on medium heat and lightly oil it.
5. Dollop the batter into the pan; I like my pancakes small (about 1.5 tbsp. each).
   Cook them until small bubbles form on their tops.
   Flip, and cook until they're done.
